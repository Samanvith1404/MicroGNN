# GNN From Scratch — Minimal Autograd + Graph Neural Network

A small, readable framework that demonstrates how a Graph Neural Network
works from the ground up. No PyTorch/TensorFlow — everything is hand-built
on a tiny autograd engine.

This repo is meant for learning, experimentation, and quick prototyping.
It’s intentionally minimal so you can see every part that matters.
